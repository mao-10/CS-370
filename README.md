# CS-370

This project uses Jupyter to create deep q-learning algorithm that trains an agent to go through an environment, looking for the optimal path to the goal. More specifically, the agent is a pirate and the goal is treasure. The pirate is searching through the environment to find the treasure. I was given the code that creates the environment and the agent. My assignment was to create the deep q-learning training method for the agent. This taught me how to create a training method for AI, and optimize the results. Approaching this assignment, I used a lot of resources to study and understand how to train an agent. It was my responsibility to create a training method that would optimize finding the goal and limit bias. While creating the method for the organization, I also had to listen to and follow their preferences.
